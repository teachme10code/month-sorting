Requirements:

Using built-in directives and filters, modify the template so it displays each
of the months in chronological order.

For each month, you'll need to display the English name, the French name, and
the number of days.

Additionally, you'll need to apply a CSS style based on the month's season.
Winter months get a white background, spring months green, summer orange, and
fall brown (you'll need to add CSS rules to accomplish this).
